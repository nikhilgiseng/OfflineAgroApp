<h1>Amravati-</h1>
<p>Main crops in Amravati jower, cotton, Maize, groudnuts, wheat</p>
<h3>Cotton-</h3>
<p>Cotton, a plant that yields the most important of all natural textile fibers. There are thousands of uses for cotton. A large part of the world's textile production is cloth made of cotton or blends of cotton and synthetic fibers. ... Cotton is one of the most important crops grown in the United States.</p>

<p><b>Climate-</b></p>
<p>Cotton is a Warm season (tropical) crop.It can be profitably grown in regions with rainfall of 850-1100 mm, but economic yields can not be realized in the region with a rainfall less than 500 mm.50cm of well-distributed rainfall is necessary for higher yields.
    In general, temperatures above 35 degree C are not desirable for cotton growing, however, when the moisture supply is favourable, the cotton plant is capable of enduring without permanent injury, very high temperatures (upto 43-45 degree C) for short periods. If these high temperatures persist for several days, however, the yields will be adversely affected.High light intensities throughout the growing period are essential for satisfactory vegetative development, for minimal shedding of buds and bolls and hence for higher yields.Cotton Crop can be grown up to 1000m altitude</p>

<p><b>Soil-</b></p>
<p>Cotton has a wide range of soil adaptation and is grown on a great variety of soils including black cotton soils. Highest yields of cotton are usually obtained on alluvial soils. High yield of cotton is dependent on favorable air and moisture regime in the soil-hence the importance of soil structure and texture.For a deep-rooting crop such as cotton, soil depth is also an important factor and shallow soils are not suitable. Cotton is not unduly sensitive to soil reactions. It can be grown on a variety of soils with pH ranging from 5 to 8 and above.
    Cotton is generally considered as fairly tolerant to salinity. Uptake of Sodium by cotton has been found to be much lower than would be expected from its relative abundance and availability in soil and water as was shown by the low accumulation of sodium in both tops and roots. This indicates that the relatively high salt-tolerance of cotton may be at least party due to the presence of some selective mechanism that enables cotton roots to restrict sodium absorption. With irrigation facilities, cotton is usually cultivated on sandy loam to loam soils.</p>

<p><b>Nutrient management-</b></p>
<p>Key nutrients:</p>
<p>The key fertilisers used in cotton production at nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K). Deficiencies are rare in other essential nutrients such as copper, boron, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, manganese, iron, zinc, cobalt and molybdenum.</p>

<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Implementing drip irrigation to grow cotton not only enables the efficient use of every drop of applied water but also leads to enhanced crop growth and yield advantages. This is due to maintenance of uniform soil moisture regime in the crop root zone by way of frequent irrigations at shorter intervals. Besides irrigation, a major component of profitable cotton production is sound and balanced fertilization. Fertigation i.e., application of fertilizers via irrigation system, ensures the efficient use of nutrients, fertilizer conservation, environmental protection and economics of cotton production. Therefore, an on farm trial was taken up to demonstrate the benefits of drip irrigation in cotton in India.</p>

<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Cotton is harvested by picking the fully opened bolls. First picking of cotton should be done when 30-35% bolls open fully. Picking should be done early in the morning. At the time of picking first pick clean cotton and then affected cotton. It should be picked separately of different varieties. Second picking should be done 15-20 days after first picking. After picking it should be dried 3-4 days in sun with due care. Cotton should be stored at clean and dry place.</p>











<h3>Jower-<h3>

    <p>Jowar or Sorghum is one of the major staple food grain crops in India. Next to wheat, the biggest cultivated land in India is utilized to produce jowar. This Indian food crop is cultivated in areas that receive less than 100 cm of rainfall annually. Jowar is grown well in those areas where mean monthly temperature varies from around 26 degree Celsius to 33 degree Celsius. This rabi crop is raised during the months from October to February and is mainly grown in areas where the mean monthly temperature does not fall below 15.5 degree Celsius. Jowar is mainly a rain fed crop and needs more than 30 cm of rainfall during its growing period. Hectarage under this crop decreases when there is excessive rainfall during its sowing period. </p>

    <p><b>Soil-</b></p>
    <p>Grain sorghum can be grown on many different soils.
        Sorghum will yield best on deep, fertile, well-drained loamy soils. However, it is quite tolerant of shallow soil and droughty conditions.
        Sorghum can be grown successfully on clay, clay loam, or sandy loam soils.
        Fertile, well-drained soils are important to optimize yield. Soils with clay loam or loam texture, having good water retention capacity are best suited for sorghum cultivation.</p>

    <p><b>Climate-</b></p>
    <p>Sorghum can grow in a wide range of ecological conditions and can still yield well even under unfavorable conditions of drought stress and high temperatures.
        Red dots indicate sorghum growing environment It is generally grown between 40oNorth and 40o South of the equator, in warm and hot countries characteristic of the semi-arid environment.
        Sorghum requires warm conditions but it can be grown under a wide range of conditions.
        It is also widely grown in temperate regions and at altitudes of up to 2300 m in the tropics.
        It can tolerate high temperature throughout its life cycle better than any other crop.
        Sorghum requires about 26-30oC temperature for good growth. The minimum temperature for the germination of the sorghum seed is 7 to 10oC.
        Grain sorghum does not germinate and grow well under cool soil conditions. Poor emergence
        and seedling growth may result if planted before soil temperatures reach 35oC. Sorghum is best adapted to areas having an average annual rainfall between 45 to 65 cm (17 to 25 inches).
        Although sorghum can respond to good moisture supplies, it is nevertheless one of the toughest, drought
        tolerant crops available and this tends to maintain its popularity in the regions where the weather is very unpredictable.</p>

    <p><b>Nutrient management-</b></p>
    <p>Application of FYM to the nursery</p>
    <p>•	Apply 750 kg of FYM or compost for 7.5 cents nursery and apply another 500 kg of compost or FYM for covering the seeds after sowing.
        •	Spread the manure evenly on the unploughed soil and incorporate by ploughing or apply just before last ploughing.</p>

    <p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
    <p>Peak water use for sorghum is just prior to boot stage.  Sorghum will use between 20-22 inches of water during the growing season.
        Agricultural water users can optimize water use efficiency and protect the quality of water resources by applying basic information about irrigation systems, crop water use and management practices. For optimum water use efficiency and profitability, producers need to monitor rainfall, soil moisture and crop water uses and utilize cropping systems like no-till or reduced tillage to capture and retain as much precipitation as possible.</p>


    <p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
    <p>Grain sorghum plants mature when the moisture in the grain drops to about 30 percent; however, the seed are usually too soft for harvesting when moisture content exceeds 25 percent. Attempts to harvest above 25 percent moisture will usually produce either unthreshed heads or cracked grain. The optimum harvest moisture, about 20 percent, minimizes harvest losses and drying expense.
        Because field drying is difficult and leads to excessive field losses from birds, wildlife and lodging, harvest early and dry your sorghum mechanically to maintain quality and minimize harvest losses.
        You can harvest sorghum using row crop or sickle bar headers. Raise the header high enough to harvest only the grain heads with a minimum of leaves and stalks.
        Narrow row spacing helps to discourage lodging due to adjacent plants supporting broken stalks. Consequently, a 30-inch row is usually easier to harvest than a 40-inch row.
        Combine header losses are usually less at a speed of 2.5 to 3 miles per hour; however, this speed may exceed the capacity of the combine rack and shoe if the stand is dense. In this case, you might want to take a partial swath to prevent overloading and still maintain field speed.
        Set combine reel bat speed 15 to 25 percent faster than ground speed to minimize losses. Set the reel height high enough to avoid catching under and throwing the grain heads on the ground. You may need wide reel bats if plant height varies greatly.</p>









    <h3>Wheat-</h3>
    <p>Triticum Introduction. Grown all over the world, wheat covers more of the earth's surface than any other cereal crop (1, 7, 16). However, although it takes more land space than other cereals, based on a three year average it is only the third-largest cereal crop, behind maize and rice.</p>
    <p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
    <p>Climate-</p>
    <p> Wheat is a Rabi crop. It is sown in mid-October-mid-November and harvested in March. It grows well in cool, moist climate and ripens in a warm, dry climate. The cool winters and the hot summers are conducive to a good crop. A cloudless sky having bright sunshine during ripening and harvesting periods will make better quality wheat. Winter rainfall is ideal. The climatic conditions suitable for growing wheat are given below:
        Temperature: The monthly average temperature should range between 10°C and 15°C during the period of sowing. The same should be between 21°C and 26°C during ripening period. Wheat grain does not mature fully if the temperature falls below 21°C.</p>
    <p><b>Soil-</b></p>
    <p>Wheat grows best in well drained fertile loams of either alluvial soils type or black soils type.</p>
    .

    <p><b>Watering Frequency- </b></p>
    <p>For high yields water requirements (ETm) are 450 to 650 mm depending on climate and length of growing period. The crop coefficient (kc) relating maximum evapotranspiration (ETm) to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is: during the initial stage 0.3-0.4 (15 to 20 days), the development stage 0.7-0.8 (25 to 30 days), the mid-season stage 1.05-1.2 (50 to 65 days), the late-season stage 0.65-0.7 (30 to 40 days) and at harvest 0.2-0.25.</p>

    <p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
    <p>Harvest. Harvesting is the process of gathering a ripe crop from the fields. Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle, or reaper. On smaller farms with minimal mechanization, harvesting is the most labor-intensive activity of the growing season.</p>
