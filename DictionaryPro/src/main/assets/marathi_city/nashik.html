<p>Main crops in Nashik bajra,rice, maize, wheat </p>.
<h3>Wheat-</h3>
<p>Triticum Introduction. Grown all over the world, wheat covers more of the earth's surface than any other cereal crop (1, 7, 16). However, although it takes more land space than other cereals, based on a three year average it is only the third-largest cereal crop, behind maize and rice</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate- Wheat is a Rabi crop. It is sown in mid-October-mid-November and harvested in March. It grows well in cool, moist climate and ripens in a warm, dry climate. The cool winters and the hot summers are conducive to a good crop. A cloudless sky having bright sunshine during ripening and harvesting periods will make better quality wheat. Winter rainfall is ideal. The climatic conditions suitable for growing wheat are given below:</p>
<p>Temperature: The monthly average temperature should range between 10°C and 15°C during the period of sowing. The same should be between 21°C and 26°C during ripening period. Wheat grain does not mature fully if the temperature falls below 21°C.</p>
<p>Soil- Wheat grows best in well drained fertile loams of either alluvial soils type or black soils type.</p>
<p><b>Nutrient management-</b></p>
<p>Nitrogen Supply</p>

<p>There are a number of sources from which wheat plants can obtain nitrogen:
    1.	Available nitrogen stored in the soil at planting.
    2.	Nitrogen released from soil organic matter breakdown during the growing season.
    3.	Nitrogen may be released from the breakdown of plant residue following a legume crop.
    4.	Addition of inorganic commercial fertilizer or animal manure.
    5.	Up to 20 kg/ha (18 lb/ac) of N during the growing season can be added from rainfall primarily from lightning storms.</p>

<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>For high yields water requirements (ETm) are 450 to 650 mm depending on climate and length of growing period. The crop coefficient (kc) relating maximum evapotranspiration (ETm) to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is: during the initial stage 0.3-0.4 (15 to 20 days), the development stage 0.7-0.8 (25 to 30 days), the mid-season stage 1.05-1.2 (50 to 65 days), the late-season stage 0.65-0.7 (30 to 40 days) and at harvest 0.2-0.25.</p>

<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Harvest. Harvesting is the process of gathering a ripe crop from the fields. Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle, or reaper. On smaller farms with minimal mechanization, harvesting is the most labor-intensive activity of the growing season.</p>



<h3>Rice-</h3>
<p>Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 105–150 days after crop establishment. Harvesting activities include cutting, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Good harvesting methods help maximize grain yield and minimize grain damage and deterioration.</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate-
    Rice is the staple crop of India. It is grown well in hot and moist climate. The geographical conditions for Rice Cultivation are : Temperature: 16°C – 27°C and rainfall 100 cm to 200 cm is ideal for rice growing.</p>
<p>Soil-
    If the mean temperature is found favourable for rice cultivation through out the year then, two or three crops of rice are grown in a year.Where rainfall is high and winter temperature is fairly low, only one crop of rice is grown.</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Rice is typically grown in bunded fields that are continuously flooded up to 7-10 days before harvest.
    Continuous flooding helps ensure sufficient water and control weeds.
    Lowland rice requires a lot of water.
    On average, it takes 1,432 liters of water to produce 1 kg of rice in an irrigated lowland production system. Total seasonal water input to rice fields varies from as little as 400 mm in heavy clay soils with shallow groundwater tables to more than 2000 mm in coarse-textured (sandy or loamy) soils with deep groundwater tables.
    Around 1300-1500 mm is a typical amount of water needed for irrigated rice in Asia. Irrigated rice receives an estimated 34-43% of the total world’s irrigation water, or about 24-30% of the entire world’s developed fresh water resources.
    Worldwide, water for agriculture is becoming increasingly scarce. Due to its semi-aquatic ancestry, rice is extremely sensitive to water shortages.</p>


<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Harvesting is the process of collecting the mature rice crop from the field. Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 105–150 days after crop establishment. Harvesting activities include cutting, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Good harvesting methods help maximize grain yield and minimize grain damage and deterioration.</p>
<p>Harvesting can be done manually or mechanically:
    Manual harvesting is common across Asia It involves cutting the rice crop with simple hand tools like sickles and knives. Manual harvesting is very effective when a crop has lodged or fallen over, however it is labor intensive. Manual harvesting requires 40 to 80 hours per hectare and it takes additional labor to manually collect and haul the harvested crop.
    Mechanical harvesting using reapers or combine harvesters is the other option, but not so common due to the availability and cost of machinery. Following cutting the rice must be threshed to separate the grain from the stalk and cleaned. These processes can also be done by hand or machine.</p>
