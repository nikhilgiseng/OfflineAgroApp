<p>In general, Custard apple is grown as a rainfed crop, and no irrigation given. However, for early and bumper harvest of the crop irrigation at flowering i.e. from May should be given till regular monsoon starts. For better flowering and fruit setting, mist sprinkling is better over flood or drip system of irrigation as it keeps to lower down the temperatures and to increase in the relative humidity.</p>
<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>The fruits are to be harvested at correct stage of maturity. Light green fruit colour, yellowish white colour between the carpels and initiation of cracking of the skin between the carpels may be taken as maturity indices. The fruits are handpicked. The peak harvest period is October-November. A sugar apple tree usually produces 80-100 fruits per tree after 4 to 5 years.
    The custard apples ripen within a few days after harvest. The mature fruits can be stored at 15 to 20 degree C with RH of 85-90 % and low oxygen and ethylene but with 10% CO2. Under such storage conditions, the fruts can be kept intact for 12-18 days.
    Additives like Saccharified starch (1:1), high voltage treatment and packing under nitrogen gas cover, sugar (1:2) were quite effective in extending the storage of pulp at 4 degree C (45 days) and√Ç  minus 18 Degree C (90 days) temperature.
