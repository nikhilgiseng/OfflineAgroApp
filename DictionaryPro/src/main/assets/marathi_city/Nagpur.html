<h3>Mug dal( green gram)</h3>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The greengram is a leguminous species, or pulse crop, grown mainly for its protein rich edible seeds. The greengram, also called mung, moong and mungbean in India and mungo in the Philippines, is prized among the pulse species, for its seeds are high in protein and easily digested when consumed as food. In symbiotic relationship with specific soil rhizobia of the genus Bradirhizobium, root nodules develop on moongbean in which atmospheric nitrogen is converted to forms available to the plant.</p>


<p><b>Soil and climate</b></p>

<p>Generally deep, well drained loam or sandy loam soils are very much suitable for cultivation of mungbean. It is a short day, warm season crop, grown mainly in semiarid to subhumid tropics with 600 to 1000 mm annual rainfall, 20 to 30 degreeÂ C mean temperature during the period of crop production and elevations not exceeding 1800 to 2000 m.</p>

<p>Planting season:

    The main planting season of greengram is considered to be first week of June- first week of July, at the onset of the South West monsoon.</p>



<p><b>Harvesting</b></p>


<p>The pods should be separated from the plant and threshed to separate the seeds. Or, entire plant may be cut at the ground level and threshed and cleaned.</p>


<h3>Sugar Cane-</h3>

<p>Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. Sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L., an old energy source for human beings and, more recently, a replacement of fossil fuel for motor vehicles, was first grown in South East Asia and Western India. Around 327 B.C. it was an important crop in the Indian sub-continent. It was introduced to Egypt around 647 A.D. and, about one century later, to Spain (755 A.D.).

    Since then, the cultivation of sugarcane was extended to nearly all tropical and sub-tropical regions. Portuguese and Spaniards took it to the New World early in the XVI century. It was introduced to the United States of America (Louisiana) around 1741.</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate-
    •	A long, warm growing season with a high incidence of solar radiation and adequate moisture (rainfall) - the plant uses from 148 to 300g of water to produce 1.0g of dry substance.

    •	A fairly dry, sunny and cool, but frost free season for ripening and harvesting - moisture percentage drops steadily throughout the life of the sugarcane plant, from 83% in very young cane to 71% in mature cane, meanwhile sucrose grows from less than 10 to more than 45% of the dry weight.

    •	Freedom from typhoons and hurricanes</p>
<p>Soil-
    Soil is a medium for plant growth. It provides nutrients, water and anchorage to the growing plants. Maintenance of proper physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil is necessary for realizing higher growth, yield and quality of sugarcane. Sugarcane does not require any specific type of soil as it can be successfully raised on diverse soil types ranging from sandy soils to clay loams & heavy clays.

    A well drained, deep, loamy soil with a bulk density of 1.1 to 1.2 g/cm3 (1.3-1.4 g/cm3 in sandy soils) and total porosity, with an adequate balance between pores of various sizes, is higher than 50%; ground water table below 1.5 to 2.0 m from soil surface and an available water holding capacity of 15% or more (15 cm per meter depth of soil is considered ideal for sugarcane cultivation).</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Adequate available moisture throughout the growing period is important for obtaining maximum yields because vegetative growth including cane growth is directly proportional to the water transpired. Depending on climate, water requirements (ETm) of sugarcane are 1500 to 2500 mm evenly distributed over the growing season.
    The crop coefficient (kc) values, relating ETm to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for the different growth stages are presented in the following table.</p>

<p><b>Harvesting-</b><p>
<p>Harvesting of sugarcane at a proper time i.e., peak maturity, by adopting right technique is necessary to realize maximum weight of the millable canes (thus sugar) produced with least possible field losses under the given growing environment
    •	To harvest the cane at peak maturity (i.e., avoiding cutting of either over-matured or under-matured cane)
    •	Cutting cane to ground level so that the bottom sugar rich internodes are harvested which add to yield and sugar
    •	De-topping at appropriate height so that the top immature internodes are eliminated
    •	Proper cleaning of the cane i.e., removing the extraneous matter such as leaves, trash, roots etc.
    •	Quick disposal of the harvested cane to factory</p>
