<p>Main crops in Mumbai cotton,sugarcane,Nachani and Rice</p>
<h3>Rice-</h3>
<p>Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 105–150 days after crop establishment. Harvesting activities include cutting, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Good harvesting methods help maximize grain yield and minimize grain damage and deterioration.</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate-
    Rice is the staple crop of India. It is grown well in hot and moist climate. The geographical conditions for Rice Cultivation are : Temperature: 16°C – 27°C and rainfall 100 cm to 200 cm is ideal for rice growing.</p>
<p>Soil-
    If the mean temperature is found favourable for rice cultivation through out the year then, two or three crops of rice are grown in a year.Where rainfall is high and winter temperature is fairly low, only one crop of rice is grown. There are three seasons for growing rice</p>
<p><b>Nutrient management-</b><p>
<p>•	Apply 1 tonne of fully decomposed FYM or compost to 20 cents nursery and spread the manure uniformly on dry soil.
    •	Basal application of DAP is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20-25 days after sowing in less fertile nursery soils.
    •	For that situation, before the last puddling, apply 40 kg of DAP and if not readily available, apply straight fertilizers 16 kg of urea and 120 kg of super phosphate.
    •	If seedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application of DAP is to be done 10 days prior to pulling out.
    •	For clayey soils where root snapping is a problem, 4 kg of gypsum and 1 kg of DAP/cent can be applied at 10 days after sowing.</p>

<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Rice is typically grown in bunded fields that are continuously flooded up to 7-10 days before harvest.
    Continuous flooding helps ensure sufficient water and control weeds.
    Lowland rice requires a lot of water.
    On average, it takes 1,432 liters of water to produce 1 kg of rice in an irrigated lowland production system. Total seasonal water input to rice fields varies from as little as 400 mm in heavy clay soils with shallow groundwater tables to more than 2000 mm in coarse-textured (sandy or loamy) soils with deep groundwater tables.
    Around 1300-1500 mm is a typical amount of water needed for irrigated rice in Asia. Irrigated rice receives an estimated 34-43% of the total world’s irrigation water, or about 24-30% of the entire world’s developed fresh water resources.
    Worldwide, water for agriculture is becoming increasingly scarce. Due to its semi-aquatic ancestry, rice is extremely sensitive to water shortages.</p>



<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Harvesting is the process of collecting the mature rice crop from the field. Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 105–150 days after crop establishment. Harvesting activities include cutting, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Good harvesting methods help maximize grain yield and minimize grain damage and deterioration.</p>

<p>Harvesting can be done manually or mechanically:
    Manual harvesting is common across Asia It involves cutting the rice crop with simple hand tools like sickles and knives. Manual harvesting is very effective when a crop has lodged or fallen over, however it is labor intensive. Manual harvesting requires 40 to 80 hours per hectare and it takes additional labor to manually collect and haul the harvested crop.
    Mechanical harvesting using reapers or combine harvesters is the other option, but not so common due to the availability and cost of machinery. Following cutting the rice must be threshed to separate the grain from the stalk and cleaned. These processes can also be done by hand or machine.</p>

<h3>Sugar Cane-</h3>
<p>Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. Sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L., an old energy source for human beings and, more recently, a replacement of fossil fuel for motor vehicles, was first grown in South East Asia and Western India. Around 327 B.C. it was an important crop in the Indian sub-continent. It was introduced to Egypt around 647 A.D. and, about one century later, to Spain (755 A.D.)

    Since then, the cultivation of sugarcane was extended to nearly all tropical and sub-tropical regions. Portuguese and Spaniards took it to the New World early in the XVI century. It was introduced to the United States of America (Louisiana) around 1741.</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate-
    •	A long, warm growing season with a high incidence of solar radiation and adequate moisture (rainfall) - the plant uses from 148 to 300g of water to produce 1.0g of dry substance.

    •	A fairly dry, sunny and cool, but frost free season for ripening and harvesting - moisture percentage drops steadily throughout the life of the sugarcane plant, from 83% in very young cane to 71% in mature cane, meanwhile sucrose grows from less than 10 to more than 45% of the dry weight.

    •	Freedom from typhoons and hurricanes</p>
<p>Soil-
    Soil is a medium for plant growth. It provides nutrients, water and anchorage to the growing plants. Maintenance of proper physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil is necessary for realizing higher growth, yield and quality of sugarcane. Sugarcane does not require any specific type of soil as it can be successfully raised on diverse soil types ranging from sandy soils to clay loams & heavy clays.

    A well drained, deep, loamy soil with a bulk density of 1.1 to 1.2 g/cm3 (1.3-1.4 g/cm3 in sandy soils) and total porosity, with an adequate balance between pores of various sizes, is higher than 50%; ground water table below 1.5 to 2.0 m from soil surface and an available water holding capacity of 15% or more (15 cm per meter depth of soil is considered ideal for sugarcane cultivation).</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency- </b></p>
<p>Adequate available moisture throughout the growing period is important for obtaining maximum yields because vegetative growth including cane growth is directly proportional to the water transpired. Depending on climate, water requirements (ETm) of sugarcane are 1500 to 2500 mm evenly distributed over the growing season.
    The crop coefficient (kc) values, relating ETm to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for the different growth stages are presented in the following table.
</p>
<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Harvesting of sugarcane at a proper time i.e., peak maturity, by adopting right technique is necessary to realize maximum weight of the millable canes (thus sugar) produced with least possible field losses under the given growing environment</p>
<p>•	To harvest the cane at peak maturity (i.e., avoiding cutting of either over-matured or under-matured cane)
    •	Cutting cane to ground level so that the bottom sugar rich internodes are harvested which add to yield and sugar
    •	De-topping at appropriate height so that the top immature internodes are eliminated
    •	Proper cleaning of the cane i.e., removing the extraneous matter such as leaves, trash, roots etc.
    •	Quick disposal of the harvested cane to factory</p>
<h3>Cotton-</h3>
<p>Cotton, a plant that yields the most important of all natural textile fibers. There are thousands of uses for cotton. A large part of the world's textile production is cloth made of cotton or blends of cotton and synthetic fibers. ... Cotton is one of the most important crops grown in the United States</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate-
    Cotton is a Warm season (tropical) crop.It can be profitably grown in regions with rainfall of 850-1100 mm, but economic yields can not be realized in the region with a rainfall less than 500 mm.50cm of well-distributed rainfall is necessary for higher yields.
    In general, temperatures above 35 degree C are not desirable for cotton growing, however, when the moisture supply is favourable, the cotton plant is capable of enduring without permanent injury, very high temperatures (upto 43-45 degree C) for short periods. If these high temperatures persist for several days, however, the yields will be adversely affected.High light intensities throughout the growing period are essential for satisfactory vegetative development, for minimal shedding of buds and bolls and hence for higher yields.Cotton Crop can be grown up to 1000m altitude</p>

<p>Soil- Cotton has a wide range of soil adaptation and is grown on a great variety of soils including black cotton soils. Highest yields of cotton are usually obtained on alluvial soils. High yield of cotton is dependent on favorable air and moisture regime in the soil-hence the importance of soil structure and texture.For a deep-rooting crop such as cotton, soil depth is also an important factor and shallow soils are not suitable. Cotton is not unduly sensitive to soil reactions. It can be grown on a variety of soils with pH ranging from 5 to 8 and above.
    Cotton is generally considered as fairly tolerant to salinity. Uptake of Sodium by cotton has been found to be much lower than would be expected from its relative abundance and availability in soil and water as was shown by the low accumulation of sodium in both tops and roots. This indicates that the relatively high salt-tolerance of cotton may be at least party due to the presence of some selective mechanism that enables cotton roots to restrict sodium absorption. With irrigation facilities, cotton is usually cultivated on sandy loam to loam soils</p>
<p><b>Nutrient management-</b></p>
<p>Key nutrients:
    The key fertilisers used in cotton production at nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K). Deficiencies are rare in other essential nutrients such as copper, boron, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, manganese, iron, zinc, cobalt and molybdenum.</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Implementing drip irrigation to grow cotton not only enables the efficient use of every drop of applied water but also leads to enhanced crop growth and yield advantages. This is due to maintenance of uniform soil moisture regime in the crop root zone by way of frequent irrigations at shorter intervals. Besides irrigation, a major component of profitable cotton production is sound and balanced fertilization. Fertigation i.e., application of fertilizers via irrigation system, ensures the efficient use of nutrients, fertilizer conservation, environmental protection and economics of cotton production. Therefore, an on farm trial was taken up to demonstrate the benefits of drip irrigation in cotton in India.</p>
<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Cotton is harvested by picking the fully opened bolls. First picking of cotton should be done when 30-35% bolls open fully. Picking should be done early in the morning. At the time of picking first pick clean cotton and then affected cotton. It should be picked separately of different varieties. Second picking should be done 15-20 days after first picking. After picking it should be dried 3-4 days in sun with due care. Cotton should be stored at clean and dry place.</p>
