<h3>Jower-</h3>

<p>Jowar or Sorghum is one of the major staple food grain crops in India. Next to wheat, the biggest cultivated land in India is utilized to produce jowar. This Indian food crop is cultivated in areas that receive less than 100 cm of rainfall annually. Jowar is grown well in those areas where mean monthly temperature varies from around 26 degree Celsius to 33 degree Celsius. This rabi crop is raised during the months from October to February and is mainly grown in areas where the mean monthly temperature does not fall below 15.5 degree Celsius. Jowar is mainly a rain fed crop and needs more than 30 cm of rainfall during its growing period. Hectarage under this crop decreases when there is excessive rainfall during its sowing period. </p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Soil-
    Grain sorghum can be grown on many different soils.
    Sorghum will yield best on deep, fertile, well-drained loamy soils. However, it is quite tolerant of shallow soil and droughty conditions.
    Sorghum can be grown successfully on clay, clay loam, or sandy loam soils.
    Fertile, well-drained soils are important to optimize yield. Soils with clay loam or loam texture, having good water retention capacity are best suited for sorghum cultivation.</p>
<p>Climate-
    Sorghum can grow in a wide range of ecological conditions and can still yield well even under unfavorable conditions of drought stress and high temperatures.
    Red dots indicate sorghum growing environment It is generally grown between 40oNorth and 40o South of the equator, in warm and hot countries characteristic of the semi-arid environment.
    Sorghum requires warm conditions but it can be grown under a wide range of conditions.
    It is also widely grown in temperate regions and at altitudes of up to 2300 m in the tropics.
    It can tolerate high temperature throughout its life cycle better than any other crop.
    Sorghum requires about 26-30oC temperature for good growth. The minimum temperature for the germination of the sorghum seed is 7 to 10oC.
    Grain sorghum does not germinate and grow well under cool soil conditions. Poor emergence
    and seedling growth may result if planted before soil temperatures reach 35oC. Sorghum is best adapted to areas having an average annual rainfall between 45 to 65 cm (17 to 25 inches).
    Although sorghum can respond to good moisture supplies, it is nevertheless one of the toughest, drought
    tolerant crops available and this tends to maintain its popularity in the regions where the weather is very unpredictable.</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Peak water use for sorghum is just prior to boot stage.  Sorghum will use between 20-22 inches of water during the growing season.
    Agricultural water users can optimize water use efficiency and protect the quality of water resources by applying basic information about irrigation systems, crop water use and management practices. For optimum water use efficiency and profitability, producers need to monitor rainfall, soil moisture and crop water uses and utilize cropping systems like no-till or reduced tillage to capture and retain as much precipitation as possible.</p>

<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Grain sorghum plants mature when the moisture in the grain drops to about 30 percent; however, the seed are usually too soft for harvesting when moisture content exceeds 25 percent. Attempts to harvest above 25 percent moisture will usually produce either unthreshed heads or cracked grain. The optimum harvest moisture, about 20 percent, minimizes harvest losses and drying expense.
    Because field drying is difficult and leads to excessive field losses from birds, wildlife and lodging, harvest early and dry your sorghum mechanically to maintain quality and minimize harvest losses.
    You can harvest sorghum using row crop or sickle bar headers. Raise the header high enough to harvest only the grain heads with a minimum of leaves and stalks.
    Narrow row spacing helps to discourage lodging due to adjacent plants supporting broken stalks. Consequently, a 30-inch row is usually easier to harvest than a 40-inch row.</p>








<h3>Rice-</h3>
<p>Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 105–150 days after crop establishment. Harvesting activities include cutting, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Good harvesting methods help maximize grain yield and minimize grain damage and deterioration.</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate-
    Rice is the staple crop of India. It is grown well in hot and moist climate. The geographical conditions for Rice Cultivation are : Temperature: 16°C – 27°C and rainfall 100 cm to 200 cm is ideal for rice growing.</p>
<p>Soil-
    If the mean temperature is found favourable for rice cultivation through out the year then, two or three crops of rice are grown in a year.Where rainfall is high and winter temperature is fairly low, only one crop of rice is grown. </p>

<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Rice is typically grown in bunded fields that are continuously flooded up to 7-10 days before harvest.
    Continuous flooding helps ensure sufficient water and control weeds.
    Lowland rice requires a lot of water.
    On average, it takes 1,432 liters of water to produce 1 kg of rice in an irrigated lowland production system. Total seasonal water input to rice fields varies from as little as 400 mm in heavy clay soils with shallow groundwater tables to more than 2000 mm in coarse-textured (sandy or loamy) soils with deep groundwater tables.
    Around 1300-1500 mm is a typical amount of water needed for irrigated rice in Asia. Irrigated rice receives an estimated 34-43% of the total world’s irrigation water, or about 24-30% of the entire world’s developed fresh water resources.
    Worldwide, water for agriculture is becoming increasingly scarce. Due to its semi-aquatic ancestry, rice is extremely sensitive to water shortages.</p>



<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Harvesting is the process of collecting the mature rice crop from the field. Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 105–150 days after crop establishment. Harvesting activities include cutting, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Good harvesting methods help maximize grain yield and minimize grain damage and deterioration.
    Harvesting can be done manually or mechanically:
    Manual harvesting is common across Asia It involves cutting the rice crop with simple hand tools like sickles and knives. Manual harvesting is very effective when a crop has lodged or fallen over, however it is labor intensive. Manual harvesting requires 40 to 80 hours per hectare and it takes additional labor to manually collect and haul the harvested crop.
    Mechanical harvesting using reapers or combine harvesters is the other option, but not so common due to the availability and cost of machinery. Following cutting the rice must be threshed to separate the grain from the stalk and cleaned. These processes can also be done by hand or machine.</p>



<h3>Wheat-</h3>
<p>Triticum Introduction. Grown all over the world, wheat covers more of the earth's surface than any other cereal crop (1, 7, 16). However, although it takes more land space than other cereals, based on a three year average it is only the third-largest cereal crop, behind maize and rice</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>
    Climate- Wheat is a Rabi crop. It is sown in mid-October-mid-November and harvested in March. It grows well in cool, moist climate and ripens in a warm, dry climate. The cool winters and the hot summers are conducive to a good crop. A cloudless sky having bright sunshine during ripening and harvesting periods will make better quality wheat. Winter rainfall is ideal. The climatic conditions suitable for growing wheat are given below:</p>
<p>Temperature: The monthly average temperature should range between 10°C and 15°C during the period of sowing. The same should be between 21°C and 26°C during ripening period. Wheat grain does not mature fully if the temperature falls below 21°C.
    Soil- Wheat grows best in well drained fertile loams of either alluvial soils type or black soils type.</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency- </b></p>
<p>For high yields water requirements (ETm) are 450 to 650 mm depending on climate and length of growing period. The crop coefficient (kc) relating maximum evapotranspiration (ETm) to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is: during the initial stage 0.3-0.4 (15 to 20 days), the development stage 0.7-0.8 (25 to 30 days), the mid-season stage 1.05-1.2 (50 to 65 days), the late-season stage 0.65-0.7 (30 to 40 days) and at harvest 0.2-0.25.</p>

<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Harvest. Harvesting is the process of gathering a ripe crop from the fields. Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle, or reaper. On smaller farms with minimal mechanization, harvesting is the most labor-intensive activity of the growing season.</p>


<h3>Sugar Cane-</h3>
<p>Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. Sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L., an old energy source for human beings and, more recently, a replacement of fossil fuel for motor vehicles, was first grown in South East Asia and Western India. Around 327 B.C. it was an important crop in the Indian sub-continent. It was introduced to Egypt around 647 A.D. and, about one century later, to Spain (755 A.D.).

    Since then, the cultivation of sugarcane was extended to nearly all tropical and sub-tropical regions. Portuguese and Spaniards took it to the New World early in the XVI century. It was introduced to the United States of America (Louisiana) around 1741.</p>
<p><b>Climate and Soil-</b></p>
<p>Climate-
    •	A long, warm growing season with a high incidence of solar radiation and adequate moisture (rainfall) - the plant uses from 148 to 300g of water to produce 1.0g of dry substance.

    •	A fairly dry, sunny and cool, but frost free season for ripening and harvesting - moisture percentage drops steadily throughout the life of the sugarcane plant, from 83% in very young cane to 71% in mature cane, meanwhile sucrose grows from less than 10 to more than 45% of the dry weight.

    •	Freedom from typhoons and hurricanes</p>
<p>Soil-
    Soil is a medium for plant growth. It provides nutrients, water and anchorage to the growing plants. Maintenance of proper physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil is necessary for realizing higher growth, yield and quality of sugarcane. Sugarcane does not require any specific type of soil as it can be successfully raised on diverse soil types ranging from sandy soils to clay loams & heavy clays.

    A well drained, deep, loamy soil with a bulk density of 1.1 to 1.2 g/cm3 (1.3-1.4 g/cm3 in sandy soils) and total porosity, with an adequate balance between pores of various sizes, is higher than 50%; ground water table below 1.5 to 2.0 m from soil surface and an available water holding capacity of 15% or more (15 cm per meter depth of soil is considered ideal for sugarcane cultivation).</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency-</b></p>
<p>Adequate available moisture throughout the growing period is important for obtaining maximum yields because vegetative growth including cane growth is directly proportional to the water transpired. Depending on climate, water requirements (ETm) of sugarcane are 1500 to 2500 mm evenly distributed over the growing season.
    The crop coefficient (kc) values, relating ETm to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for the different growth stages are presented in the following table.
</p>
<p><b>Harvesting-</b></p>
<p>Harvesting of sugarcane at a proper time i.e., peak maturity, by adopting right technique is necessary to realize maximum weight of the millable canes (thus sugar) produced with least possible field losses under the given growing environment
    •	To harvest the cane at peak maturity (i.e., avoiding cutting of either over-matured or under-matured cane)
    •	Cutting cane to ground level so that the bottom sugar rich internodes are harvested which add to yield and sugar
    •	De-topping at appropriate height so that the top immature internodes are eliminated
    •	Proper cleaning of the cane i.e., removing the extraneous matter such as leaves, trash, roots etc.
    •	Quick disposal of the harvested cane to factory</p>
