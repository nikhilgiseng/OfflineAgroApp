<h1>Kolhapur-</h1>
<p>Main crops in Kolhapur rice,onion,potato,wheat</p>
<h3>Potato-</h3>
<p>Potato tubers are rich source of Vitamin B-complex and essential minerals like Iron, manganese, magnesium, phosphorous, copper and potassium. Potato fiber helps to protect from colon polyps and cancer.</p>
<p><b>Favourable Soil and Climate</b></p>

<p>Potato is cool season vegetable especially grown in temperate region. Optimum temperature during planting 20-30 degree centigrade. Optimum soil temperature for tuber growth is 17 – 19 degree centigrade. It grows well in open condition receives full sun. Potato grows in all types of soils, but light, well-drained sandy loam soils with a pH value of pH 5.5 – 6.0 are best suited.</p>
<p><b>Sowing Time</b></p>

<p>Always select the disease free and planting material from a reliable source of improved varieties such as Kufri Jawahar, Kufri Chandramukhi,Kufri Bahar, Kufri Ashoka and Kufri Chipsona-I & II etc. Cut the tubers in small pieces having at least 2 to 3 buds or eyes on every cut tuber. Sow the cut pieces in September –November at a spacing of 45 X 15 cm. Before planting treat the tubers with Emisan @ 2.5 g per litre of water for 10 minutes. Plant the sprouted tubers on ridges in 4 inch deep.</p>
<p><b>Nutrient Management</b></p>

<p>Apply 125kg compost, 800g nitrogen, 780g phosphorus and 425g potassium is required for 25 square meter area. Nitrogen in two split doses, half dose of nitrogen at the time of planting and remaining nitrogen as top dressing.</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency:</b></p>

<p>Water the plants at regular intervals. Twice in a week is with moist conditions for tuber formation.</p>
<p><b>Intercultural Operations</b></p>

<p>Earthing Up- Earthing up should be done 35-40 days after planting.
    1.Cutworms 2. Aphids, 3. Leaf Hoppers 4. Potato Tuber Moth Management- Spray of Neem oil 2ml /lit of water at 15 days interval. If infestation of these insects is heavy then spray of Rogar @ 0.01 per cent two sprays is sufficient. For cut worm control add Neem cake in December month or drench the media with Chlorpyriphos @ 2g / lit of water at 20 days interval Diseases: 1. Early blight 2. Late Blight 3. Black Scurf 4. Wart 5. Mosaic Management- Select disease free and healthy tubers and grow resistant varieties. Spray of Dithane Z-78 (@ 0.2 per cent) at 10-12 days intervals.</p>
<p><b>Harvesting and Value Addition</b></p>

<p>Potato tubers ready for harvest about 7 to 8 weeks from planting. When the leaf turns yellow and falling on the ground, it is an indication to harvest the potatoes. Harvest potatoes on a dry day as the soil will not be compact.</p>
<h3>Tomato-</h3>
<p>Tomato is a rich source of vitamins and is a very good appetizer. Lycopene, that imparts red colour to tomatoes is reported to possess anti-cancerous properties. Among fruits and vegetables, tomato ranks 16th as a source of vitamin A and 13th as a source of vitamin C.</p>
<p><b>Favourable Soil and Climate</b></p>

<p>i.	Tomato crop is most sensitive to frost. Day temperature ranging from 25-30°c are optimum for growth and fruit setting </p><p>ii.	Dry and hot weather conditions results in flower drop and poor fruit set</p><p> iii. For growing Tomato crop, a well-drained fertile light loam soils is ideal.</p>

<p><b>Nutrient Management</b></p>

<p>i.	Mix well rotted farm yard manure in beds before transplanting use nitrogenous fertilizer in three split doses: a)	First at the time of transplanting        b)	Second 30 days after planting             c)	Third at flowering & fruit set stage</p><p> ii.	Tomato is highly responsive to foliar application of nutrients, especially when applied at critical stages </p><p>iii.	Multi-k & poly feed are highly water soluble and are, suitable for foliar application & fertigation @ 1 per cent solution.</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency</b></p>

<p>i.Three stages of Irrigation are very critical: a)	Immediately after transplanting b)	Just after gap filling c)	Second flower truss appearance</p><p> ii.	Wilting in the late morning indicates that the crop needs water </p><p>iii.	Water 3 to 4 days intervals during summers & 10 to 12 days interval during winters</p><p> iv. Reduced watering near the harvesting stage improves fruit colour, reduces water content of fruits and thereby improves the fruit self-life </p><p>v.	In small area or in pot, water the crop with fountain cane</p>

<p><b>Harvesting and Value Addition</b></p>

<p>Harvest the fruits at yellowing stage which can be stored for 8-10 days at 15-18°c and 85-90 per cent relative humidity. Harvest the fruits regularly obtaining proper size otherwise late picking will decrease the number of fruits per plant.
