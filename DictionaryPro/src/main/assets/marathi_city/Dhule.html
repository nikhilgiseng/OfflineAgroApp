<p>Main crops in Dhule-papaya,groundnuts,brinjal,melon</p>
<h3>Papaya-</h3>
<p>Papaya is a rich source of vitamin- A (2020 IU per 100 g) and vitamin-C (40 mg/l00g). It contains papain a protein digesting enzyme. Unripe fruits can be used as vegetable. Ripe fruits are used for making of Jam, Jelly, and Ice-Cream, etc. It is generally grown as fruit plant in kitchen garden, home garden or nutritional garden.</p>

<p>Papaya requires well drained sandy loam soil, rich in organic matter with neutral pH-6-7 of soil. Papaya prefers warm and humid climate without frost. They can tolerate mild frost if they are protected from cold winds. It is also very sensitive to water logged conditions. Optimum temperature for germination is 21-27 degree centigrade and for growth is 25-30 degree centigrade.</p>
<p>Papaya is propagated through seeds. Grow high yielding varieties such as Pusa Majesty, Pusa Delecious, Coorg Honey Dew, Pusa Giant, Pusa Dwarf and Pusa Nanha (Suitable for pot planting or kitchen gardening). Treat the seeds with 3g of Captain per kg of seed. Generally papaya is planted all-round the year but mainly sown during June-July and February–March. Sow the seeds in June to September is the best season for planting. Avoid planting in rainy season. Potting media should be disinfected by 2 % formalin solution. Polythene bags at 1cm depth 3-4 seeds of diocious variety and 2-3 seeds of gynodicious varieties. Germination will be observed in 2-3 weeks after sowing. Drench the seedlings with Captain solution @ 2 g per litre of water to prevent damping off disease. Water the bags just after sowing the seeds with the help of rose can. Seedlings will be ready in about 50-60 days after sowing. Transplanting should be done in cloudy weather or late in evening to minimise the transplanting shock. Depth of planting should be not too deep for to reduce the attack of collar rot disease.</p>

<p><b>Nutrient Management</b></p>

<p>Add 5-6 kg well rotten FYM, 500g Neem cake, 500g bone meal, 50g nitrogen, 40g phosphorus and 40g potassium per plant at the time of planting. Apply 2 table spoonful of borax around the tree in November-December months fertilizers apply 20 cm away from the stem.</p>
<p><b>Watering Frequency</b></p>

<p>Light but regular watering is necessary for getting higher yield. Water the plants twice in a week in summer months.</p>


<h3>Brinjal</h3>

<p>Brinjal is a highly nutritive fruit vegetable.Brinjal fruits are good source of minerals like calcium, phosphorus, iron and vitamins especially the B complex. Brinjal fruit helps in lowering the blood cholesterol; white Brinjal fruits are good for diabetic patients.</p>


<p><b>Favourable Soil and Climate</b></p>
<p>i.Brinjal crop can be grown successfully on all type of soils ranging from light sand & heavy clay</p><p> ii.	Temperature range of 22-28°C during night is most favorable for growth & development. </p><p>iii.	When temperature falls below 17°C the growth is restricted. It is very sensitive to frost </p><p>iv.	Fruits developed during cold season are deformed and hard.</p>


<p><b>Favourable Soil and Climate</b></p>
<p>Make the soil friable, mix well rotted farm yard manure in the soil & layout the seed bed as per requirement. Brinjal seedlings are planted on ridges for rainy season crop & on flat bed during winter season.</p>

<p><b>Nutrient Management</b></p>
<p>Brinjal is a long duration crop and heavy feeder of nutrients. In addition of farm yard manure, apply recommended NPK fertilizer, apply nitrogen in three split dose First at planting, second dose 30 days & third dose 60 days after planting. Full dose of P & K is applied before planting of seedlings.</p>

<p><b>Watering Frequency</b></p>

<p>i.Water the crop just after transplanting. Brinjal plants require adequate moisture during first 75 days after transplanting </p><p>ii.Apply watering at 4-6 days intervals in summer & 10-15 days interval in winter</p><p> iii.Critical stage of water requirement is at appearance of flower & fruit setting starts Use mulches to conserve soil moisture thus reducing irrigation water requirement.</p>
